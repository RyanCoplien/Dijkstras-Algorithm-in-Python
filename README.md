This program implements Dijkstra's Algorithm for Link State Routing.

The input is a data file that contains the source node and information about every link, 
The output is a calculation of the shortest path from the source node to every other node. 

The program uses a heap queue framework implemented for the program. Online resources were used to help with a better complexity.

***HOW TO USE***:
I have developed an additional batch file. Please place the directory to the LinkState file and the data file and run the batch file.
